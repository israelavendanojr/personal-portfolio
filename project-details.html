                <p>These projects focus on developing modular and scalable game mechanics in Unity, utilizing a component-based architecture that allows for easy updates, extensions, and asset reuse across different game levels. By applying Object-Oriented Design Patterns such as the Observer, Factory, and State pattern, the projects maintain a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase.</p>
                <p>Each project emphasizes optimized performance, player engagement, and intuitive gameplay mechanics. Unityâ€™s built-in testing and debugging tools are used to refine mechanics, ensuring a smooth and user-centered player experience. Additionally, projects explore AI behavior, physics-based interactions, and multiplayer functionality to create dynamic and immersive gameplay.</p>
                <p>Beyond programming, these projects incorporate original game design, pixel art asset creation using Aseprite, and music composition in FL Studio to deliver a cohesive and polished game experience. From designing compelling mechanics and level layouts to crafting visually distinct sprites and immersive soundtracks, each aspect contributes to a well-rounded, engaging game.</p>

                <p>This project involves developing a custom Unix shell in C, named <code>myshell</code>, that mimics the core functionalities of a terminal. The shell supports built-in commands such as <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, and <code>exit</code>, while also executing external system commands. It utilizes the <code>fork-exec-wait</code> pattern to manage child processes efficiently.</p>
                <p><code>myshell</code> features a robust argument parsing system that processes user input, handling commands and their arguments with flexible whitespace support. The implementation ensures proper memory management through dynamic allocation, with validation using Valgrind to detect and optimize memory usage.</p>

                <h1>Unix MicroShell</h1>

                <img src="images/projects/myShell/terminal_myshell.png" width="700px">

                <p>Custom Unix Shell is a C-based project that involved developing a microshell, myshell, which mimics the functionality of a terminal. The shell supports both built-in commands (e.g., pwd, cd, exit) and external system commands, allowing the user to execute typical terminal operations.</p>
                <p>The program reads user input line-by-line, parses the commands, and executes them either as built-in functions or default Unix commands.</p>
                <p>The project also focused on dynamic memory allocation and the use of Valgrind to detect and optimize memory leaks, ensuring efficient memory management throughout the program. Overall, the project demonstrated a deep understanding of system calls, memory management, and process execution in C while emphasizing robust code quality and optimization.</p>
